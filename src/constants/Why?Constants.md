Yes, your sir's suggestion is accurate. It's a good practice to maintain a separate `constants/index.jsx` (or similar) file for managing text data, rather than embedding text directly within React components. Here’s why:

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - React components should focus on rendering UI and handling logic, while text content and other constants should be kept separate to make the code cleaner and easier to manage.
   - By separating static content (like labels, headings, etc.) into a constants file, your components become more modular and focused solely on rendering and functionality.

### 2. **Ease of Debugging**
   - Mixing text data with logic inside a functional component can clutter the code and make debugging more difficult. If a component contains large chunks of text and logic together, it increases cognitive load when trying to isolate issues or read the code.
   - If text is stored in a constants file, you can easily debug or modify the text without touching the component logic, reducing the risk of introducing new bugs.

### 3. **Reusability**
   - Storing text and constants in a single file allows for reusing the same strings across multiple components. This avoids redundancy and ensures consistency across your app. If you change a string in the constants file, it will reflect everywhere it's used, preventing inconsistencies.
   
### 4. **Localization and Internationalization (i18n)**
   - When scaling the application or supporting multiple languages, managing text separately is crucial. Using a `constants` file or even more sophisticated tools like i18n libraries helps facilitate easy translation and text management for different locales.
   - If all text is embedded in components, internationalization becomes very challenging and error-prone, because you would need to extract and update text in multiple places.

### 5. **Production-Level Best Practices**
   - In production environments, maintaining a clear and well-structured codebase is crucial. Putting all text directly into components may work for small projects but becomes unmanageable for larger applications.
   - Separating constants makes the code more scalable and easier to maintain as the project grows.

### 6. **Maintainability**
   - Storing text in a separate file makes it easier to modify and update. For instance, if you need to change button labels, titles, or tooltips, you can do it in one place without sifting through multiple component files.
   - It’s especially useful when you have to update content across different parts of the app, as you can do it from a single location.

### Example Structure
```jsx
// constants/index.jsx
export const TEXT_CONSTANTS = {
  HOME_PAGE_TITLE: "Welcome to Our Website",
  SUBMIT_BUTTON: "Submit",
  ABOUT_SECTION_TITLE: "About Us",
  // other text constants
};

// components/Home.jsx
import { TEXT_CONSTANTS } from "../constants";

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{TEXT_CONSTANTS.HOME_PAGE_TITLE}</h1>
      <button>{TEXT_CONSTANTS.SUBMIT_BUTTON}</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Conclusion
Maintaining a `constants/index.jsx` or similar folder for text and static data not only improves code structure but also facilitates debugging, reusability, localization, and maintainability. It's a widely recommended practice for production-ready apps, especially as they scale.
